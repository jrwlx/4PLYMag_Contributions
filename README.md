Code and Datasets used for 4PLY

Thank you Pete for making this happen!

And this project was heavily inspired by Jared Wilbur's (https://github.com/jwilber) breakdown of Eric Koston. http://4plymag.com/koston/

DATASETS

Collected manually through watching youtube videos.

There are some errors in the datasets such as:
- inconsistent trick naming (ex. noseslide vs nose)
- misspelled trick names
- trick names I did not know (ex. lots of transition tricks)
But were remedied to the best of my ability in the code.

CODE 

It's probably not the most optimized code, but I tried to my best to organize and make it easy to read.
